# QUICK TASKS

## Description

This is a website that I am developing as a Codecademy project. The purpose of this website is to allow visitors to easily add tasks using specific fields, and then mark them as completed by clicking on the task. It is designed to be simple and user-friendly.

## Features

1. Ability to add your tasks not more than 3
2. Ability to click to complete them

At this point it is all - just add and compelte :)
